The Patinaje Ardiente Competition presents itself as an exciting initiative aimed at promoting inline skating and exploring the iconic landmarks of Barcelona through an incredibly innovative approach. This event consists of an individual inline skating competition in which all participants start from the same point, and the playing field encompasses a specific district of Barcelona. Each district houses a series of emblematic points, known as "hotspots". Upon beginning the competition, competitors head to the designated hotspot, which is valid for scoring during a 20-minute interval. The main objective is to reach the hotspot and capture a selfie in the shortest possible time, thus accumulating the maximum amount of points.

Once the 20 minutes have passed, another point becomes active, also during the same time span. This process is sequentially repeated until a total of 5 hotspots have been addressed. The competition extends over a period of 100 minutes, and the individual scores of each participant are composed of the sum of the points obtained at each of the 5 hotspots.

This thrilling competition takes place every Sunday in different districts of Barcelona, at 6:00 p.m. Since the city has a total of 10 districts, the competition spans a period of 10 weeks, equivalent to 2 and a half months. At the end of each session in a particular district, the winner is honoured with a commemorative diploma. Furthermore, upon concluding the season, which encompasses participation in all 10 districts of Barcelona, a special prize is awarded to the overall winner of the competition.

Likewise, participants' regular attendance is acknowledged, as a prize is granted through a drawing, incentivizing consistent participation in the various competitions throughout the season. The Patinaje Ardiente Competition represents a unique opportunity to blend sport, exploration, and fun in the captivating city of Barcelona.
